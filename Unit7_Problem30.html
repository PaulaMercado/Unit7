    <title>Object: Date Constructor</title>

<!-- 30. JavaScript comes with a built-in object called Date, which is a constructor.
Research this function and answer the following:
(a) What does the expression new Date() produce?
(b) What does the expression new Date( 2009,0,20) produce?
(c) If d1 and d2 refer to date objects, what does the expression
d1. valueOf() - d2. valueOf() produce? -->
<h3></h3>
<p>
    (A) The object Date produces the current time and date it is. When I tried to use it this is what
    returned in the browser: Thu Jul 14 2016 20:34:58 GMT-0700 (PDT). <br> You can also see a live example
    of it below. To use it you must type Date() and not just Date.
</p>
<p>
    (B) This object produces the date information for  January 20th 2009 with no set time.
</p>
<p>
    (C) d1 refers to a variable expression of date(). Because in this instance they have not been declared
    d1.valueOf() - d2.valueOf() does not return anything.
</p>
<script>
    document.write("This is the current time and date using the new Date() object: " + new Date());
    document.write("<br>");
    document.write("This is the result of new Date( 2009,0,20): " + new Date( 2009,0,20));
