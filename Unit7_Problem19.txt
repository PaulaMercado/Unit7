alert("Helllo");
var alert = 2
alert("World");

When this code executes it would first send out an alert with the word "Hello"
Then on line 2 it declares a variable by the name alert and sets it to two.
On line 3 it sends out another alert with the word "World". The variable value could have been
changed to world if it had been set to "World" with a = sign but instead the
operator alert was callled and not the variable.
