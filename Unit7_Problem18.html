    When this code is run it returns an alert message "HEY YOU!" <br>
    and an error message for unexpected token. The reason for this <br>
    is because the statement shout(); runs the function by the name <br>
    shout. The line after that alerts message which is a local variable <br>
    inside the function. Unless there's another variable called message, <br>
    that is global and doesn't belong to a function it will crash and <br>
    return a message in the runner that says: <br>
    "Uncaught ReferenceError: message is not defined" <br>
</p>
<script>
var shout = function () {
    var message = "HEY YOU";
    alert(message);
};
    shout();
    alert(message);
</script>
